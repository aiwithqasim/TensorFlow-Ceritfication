# TenorFlow-Ceritfication
Thatâ€™s all cool but <strong>what is Tensorflow?</strong><br>
The gist: <strong>Tensorflow</strong> is an end-to-end open-source machine learning platform. It has a comprehensive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community resources that lets ML/AI Engineers, Scientists/Analysts build and deploy ML-powered applications.<br>
Google, Airbnb, DeepMind, intel, Twitter, and many others are currently powered by Tensorflow to solve a wide gamut of problems. Now, I am not a preacher of certifications but since I was already using and following tensorflow so closely, as a Data Science Enthusiast, so it got my attention.<br>
